# Startup Hero Creator

An application that allows the admin to create artwork of a software engineer
that can then be minted as an NFT.

## Getting Started

### Smart Contract

Install all dependencies by running:

```bash
# install packages
npm install

```

I'm using Truffle and Ganache for locally interacting with the smart contract.

```bash
# start truffle
truffle compile

# compile and deploy to Ganache
# truffle migrate --network ganache
npm run ganache



```

### Front End Application

### Flask/API Server
